  in order to achieve our ambigious dream we have to have better transportation sysytem that is rocket which travel at a fast speed
  and also have cargo and passenger capacity along with that fuel capacity and intake should be optimum for large distance travel
  to moon or mars and later we can think of<em><strong> space floating human coloney</em></strong> which are self sustained and also capable of sustaining
  around 7000 people at a time with proper tools and agriculture processes these coloney can sustain upto 700 years without
  any external intervention.
